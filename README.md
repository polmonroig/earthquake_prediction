# ML Earthquake Prediction #

This repository was created to save the developement of a machine learning algorithm that solves the LANL Earthquake Prediction kaggle research contest. The best score I achieved in the contest using a stacked ensemble was 1.588(MAE).

### Prerequisites ###

    python>=3.7
    numpy>=1.16.2

### Where can I get the dataset? ###

Unfortunately the original training and testing dataset is too big, thus it is not uploaded here.
Nevertheless, you can get it from https://www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction
